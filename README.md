## **Scopus Research: Data Analytics**

Data analysis and research impact assessment using data science techniques. By leveraging data extraction, web scraping, and big data processing, we analyzed research publications from Chulalongkorn University and Kasetsart University.

Using Spark, we processed citation data and applied K-Means clustering to categorize research impact. Power BI and Streamlit were utilized for data visualization, providing insights into citation trends, international collaborations, and subject matter distribution.

The findings highlight that Chulalongkorn University has higher research output and global citation influence, while Kasetsart Universityâ€™s research is more regionally concentrated. This project demonstrates data-driven decision-making by extracting meaningful insights from large datasets, supporting academic and institutional analysis.
